bgr daemonize then runs an arbitrary command on random files in some given path every time some given
interval elapses.

As bgr stands for 'background rotator', bgr will try to run bgs by default. bgr will only glob files based on
ext_tb in config.h (default: .png, .jpg, and .jpeg). bgr can be sent SIGUSR1 to refresh its cached file list.

bgr was written as a personal experiment in an atypical style inspired by vector languages and their
implementors and is not really intended to serve much of a real purpose or even be usable.

Build by running `make`. Any make and any c99 c compiler should work.

Incorrect assumptions made by bgr:

-No directories have more than 200 (set in config.h) files with suffixes in ext_tb (also config.h)
-Every system defines and enforces MAXNAMLEN
-Sleep() never fails.
-External commands return instaneously. (bgr uses a blocking wait())
-Only one directory will ever need to be searched.
